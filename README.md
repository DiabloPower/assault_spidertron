## Description

This mod adapts the **Assault Spidertron** created by [Dave](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Dave-1993_) and brings it to the next level of functionality and compatibility with **Factorio 2.0**, including the Space Age expansion.  

### **Mod Features**
- **Enhanced Control**: Introduced remote driving capability to operate the Assault Spidertron from a distance.  
- **Logistics Network Integration**: Fully compatible with Factorio's logistics network for automated supply deliveries.  
- **Updated Recipes and Weapon Configurations**:  
  - Overhauled crafting recipe for the Assault Spidertron.  
  - Added new weapons and adjusted their stats for better game balance.  

### **Caution Regarding Explosive Weapons**
It is highly recommended **not to use explosive weaponry** (e.g., cannon shells or rockets), particularly if the unit is left under AI control. Explosive weapons can lead to self-inflicted destruction as the unit tends to fire in close quarters, ultimately damaging itself.
