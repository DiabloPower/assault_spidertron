## Description

This mod adapts the **Assault Spidertron** created by [Dave](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Dave-1993_) and brings it to the next level of functionality and compatibility with **Factorio 2.0**, including the Space Age expansion.

### **Mod Features**
- **Enhanced Control:** Remote driving capability lets you operate the Assault Spidertron from a distance.
- **Logistics Network Integration:** Fully compatible with Factorio's logistics network for automated supply deliveries.
- **Updated Recipes and Weapon Configurations:** Overhauled crafting recipe for the Assault Spidertron. Added new weapons and adjusted their stats for better game balance.
- **Arachnophobia Mode:** A toggleable mode for players who prefer an alternative visual experience. Feedback welcome!
- **Early Unlock Option:** A technology setting allows early access to the Assault Spidertron—normally unlocked after Spidertron research, but now available as early as after researching Tanks.
- **Engine Customization:** Choose between a **Void Engine** or a **Burner Engine**, with an optional smoke effect. If the **SpidertronEnhancements** mod is installed, its engine settings can be applied.
- **Automatic Weapon Switching:** Can be enabled to cycle through weapons after firing. Works best with weapons of similar range or near point-blank engagement.
- **Configurable Weapon Systems:** Each weapon system can be toggled on or off individually. Set the number of active weapons per system (1–4) for optimal customization. Available weapon systems: **Artillery Mortar, Assault Rockets, Assault Cannon, Assault MG, Assault Flamer**.

### **Caution Regarding Explosive Weapons**
It is highly recommended **not to use explosive weaponry** (e.g., cannon shells or rockets), especially when the unit is under AI control. Due to its tendency to fire in close quarters, explosive weapons can lead to self-inflicted destruction. Fortunately, a mod setting is now available to disable friendly fire, preventing accidental damage.
