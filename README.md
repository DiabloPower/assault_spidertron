### **Caution Regarding Explosive Weapons**
It is highly recommended **not to use explosive weaponry** (e.g., cannon shells or rockets), particularly if the unit is left under AI control. Explosive weapons can lead to self-inflicted destruction as the unit tends to fire in close quarters, ultimately damaging itself.
